# Enhancement: Stage Visualization
We decided to implement a stage visualizer, which provides users with a more intuitive graphical aspect to actors' movement on stage.

The visualizer is made up of a top view of the stage with the 8 positions. Actors' names will appear in their assigned position on the stage for two seconds and move to the next part of the script.

## Director's view
Directors are able to view all actors' positions for each part in the script on a two seconds interval, along with the corresponding script text. Actors' names will show under the position number.

## Actor's view
Actors are able to view positions for their parts only in the script on a two seconds interval, along with the corresponding script text. The part number will show under the position number.

## How to Use
In order to see a visualization of the script blocking, users will need to first search to get a script blocking by entering a script number (and an actor number if they are an actor) and hitting "Get Script Blocking". 

To start a visualization, simply click "Visualize Script blocking".

## Why a Visualizer?
We found the current way of displaying blockings not intuitive as it only displays numbers beside character names. Recent research showed that the human brain can process visual information 60,000 faster than text, and it is easier to remember. Since the primary goal of this app is for actors to accurately carry out their stage positions, with our users' best interest in mind, we decided to implement a stage visualizer for users of this app.

### How does it help actors?
It is frustrating when actors do not have enough stage practice time. Using this visualizer, actors can simply practice their movements off stage by following the visualizer's animation, just like a video tutorial. It improves efficiency during rehearsal since actors would come to rehearsals with their positions in mind already.


### How does it help directors?
It is hard for directors to design actors' stage movements just by looking at some numbers. Through visual imagery, this visualizer can assist directors to gain a better understanding of what the movements will look like in real life, and easily make adjustments in the app when needed. A visualizer can also assist directors during rehearsals. In a scene where many actors are involved, it is hard for directors to keep track of every actor's movement on stage. A visualizer could help in this case since it can be directly displayed on a big screen.
